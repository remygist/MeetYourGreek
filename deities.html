                <p>
                    Zeus (/zjuːs/; Ancient Greek: Ζεύς)[a] is the sky and
                    thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king of
                    the gods on Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the
                    first syllable of his Roman equivalent Jupiter.[2] Zeus is
                    the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings
                    to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the
                    others required disgorging from Cronus's stomach. In most
                    traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually
                    said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, and
                    Hephaestus.[3][4] At the oracle of Dodona, his consort was
                    said to be Dione,[5] by whom the Iliad states that he
                    fathered Aphrodite.[8] According to the Theogony, Zeus'
                    first wife was Metis, by whom he had Athena.[9] Zeus was
                    also infamous for his erotic escapades. These resulted in
                    many divine and heroic offspring, including Apollo, Artemis,
                    Hermes, Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of
                    Troy, Minos, and the Muses.[3] He was respected as a sky
                    father who was chief of the gods[10] and assigned roles to
                    the others:[11] "Even the gods who are not his natural
                    children address him as Father, and all the gods rise in his
                    presence."[12][13] He was equated with many foreign weather
                    gods, permitting Pausanias to observe "That Zeus is king in
                    heaven is a saying common to all men".[14] Zeus' symbols are
                    the thunderbolt, eagle, bull, and oak. In addition to his
                    Indo-European inheritance, the classical "cloud-gatherer"
                    (Greek: Νεφεληγερέτα, Nephelēgereta)[15] also derives
                    certain iconographic traits from the cultures of the ancient
                    Near East, such as the scepter.
