                    Hephaestus is the Greek god of artisans, blacksmiths,
                    carpenters, craftsmen, fire, metallurgy, metalworking,
                    sculpture and volcanoes. Hephaestus's Roman counterpart is
                    Vulcan. In Greek mythology, Hephaestus was either the son of
                    Zeus and Hera or he was Hera's parthenogenous child. He was
                    cast off Mount Olympus by his mother Hera because of his
                    lameness, the result of a congenital impairment; or in
                    another account, by Zeus for protecting Hera from his
                    advances (in which case his lameness would have been the
                    result of his fall rather than the reason for it). As a
                    smithing god, Hephaestus made all the weapons of the gods in
                    Olympus. He served as the blacksmith of the gods, and was
                    worshipped in the manufacturing and industrial centres of
                    Greece, particularly Athens. The cult of Hephaestus was
                    based in Lemnos. Hephaestus's symbols are a smith's hammer,
                    anvil, and a pair of tongs.
